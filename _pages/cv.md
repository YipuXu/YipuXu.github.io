## Project Experience

**Urban Computing: An Accessibility and Efficiency Analysis of Melbourne's Public Transport**  
*Urban Computing Researcher, supervised by, at Monash University, Clayton*

- **Core Research:** Systematically evaluated the public transport network in Melbourne's Box Hill area by integrating PTV GTFS and ABS geographical datasets, leveraging SQL and QGIS for spatial analysis.
- **Methods & Implementation:** Developed a comprehensive accessibility scoring model to quantify service levels and precisely identified unserved mesh blocks with over 300m walking distance. Assessed network efficiency by peak-hour passenger flow, service duration, and average waiting times.
- **Key Findings & Impact:** Revealed the network's heavy reliance on buses and insufficient rail coverage. Pinpointed low-accessibility hotspots and long-wait bottlenecks, providing data-driven optimization recommendations to Public Transport Victoria.

**Machine Learning: Predictive Analysis of Chatbot Dialogue Utility**  
*Machine Learning Researcher, supervised by, at Monash University, Clayton*

- **Core Research:** Predicted the utility scores of human-chatbot interactions using machine learning techniques and analyzed key factors influencing dialogue quality.
- **Methods & Implementation:** Engineered composite features covering both conversational structure and semantics (TF-IDF, PCA, LDA, SVD). Selected XGBoost as the core model, achieving over a 20% improvement in key metrics (RMSE/MAE) compared to baselines after hyperparameter tuning.
- **Outcome:** Utilized SHAP for model interpretability, providing deep insights for enhancing chatbot dialogue quality.

**Environmental Data Science: Correlating Bushfires, Land Cover, and Agricultural Impact**  
*Data Analytics Researcher, supervised by, at Monash University, Clayton*

- **Core Research:** Investigated the complex correlations between wildfires and agricultural ecosystems (especially wheat) by integrating diverse datasets (forestry, agriculture, meteorology, insurance).
- **Methods & Implementation:** Cleaned and integrated datasets using R; employed EDA to confirm a significant positive correlation between fire frequency and forest/grassland coverage and identified a lagged negative impact of severe fire seasons on the following year's wheat yield.
- **Outcome:** Developed linear regression and PCA models to quantify key factors and utilized a time-series approach, accounting for the "Black Summer" anomaly, to forecast future fire and agricultural trends.

**Predictive Modeling: KNN Regression for Residential Market Price Prediction**  
*Machine Learning Researcher, supervised by, at Monash University, Clayton*

- **Project Overview:** Conducted an end-to-end machine learning workflow, including feature engineering on text descriptions (regex), data preprocessing (one-hot encoding, scaling), and building an optimized KNN regression model validated with 10-fold cross-validation.

**Cloud Application Development: A Serverless Media Analysis Platform on AWS**  
*Cloud Application Developer, supervised by, at Monash University, Clayton*

- **Project Overview:** Designed and deployed a scalable, serverless cloud application. Utilized AWS Lambda and Python to implement AI-driven auto-tagging of media files upon S3 upload and provided a comprehensive media management service via a RESTful API.

## Internship Experience

**Hardware Engineer & Database Administrator at Hangzhou First People's Hospital**  
*Jul. 2022 – Apr. 2023*

- Managed software/hardware maintenance, deployment, and troubleshooting for over 500 terminal devices across 20+ clinical and administrative departments.
- Independently diagnosed and resolved an average of 25+ technical support tickets weekly, maintaining an average fault recovery time of under 2 hours and ensuring the stability of the HIS.
- Executed over 1,000 data addition and modification requests in the database with a zero-error rate.

## Research Experience

**Design and Implementation of a Human-Computer Othello Game System Based on Evaluation Functions and Game Tree Search**  
*Undergraduate Thesis Researcher, supervised by Prof. Wei Xu at Wenzhou Medical University, Zhejiang*

- **Core Research:** Investigated the AI decision-making process in human-computer games, focusing on game tree search, heuristic evaluation functions, and strategic choices.
- **Methods & Implementation:** Based on the Minimax principle, designed and implemented a composite heuristic evaluation function combining positional, mobility, and greedy strategies to guide AI decisions. Developed the complete system in C#, including data persistence.
