Hi there! I'm **Yipu Xu** (Âæê‰∫¶Áíû), a passionate data scientist and researcher currently pursuing my Master's degree in Information Technology at Monash University, Australia.

## My Story

My journey began in the vibrant city of Wenzhou, China, where I completed my Bachelor's degree in Information Management and Information Systems at Wenzhou Medical University. During those formative years, I developed a fascination for how data can tell stories and solve real-world problems.

The transition from the medical informatics landscape in China to the cutting-edge tech environment of Australia has been both challenging and rewarding. At Monash University, I've been diving deep into the intersection of urban computing, public health intelligence, and machine learning - areas that I believe will shape the future of smart cities and healthcare systems.

## Featured Projects

Here are some highlights from my portfolio that showcase my expertise in data science and urban computing:
