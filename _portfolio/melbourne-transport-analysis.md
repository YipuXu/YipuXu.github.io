# Urban Computing: Accessibility and Efficiency Analysis of Melbourne's Public Transport

## Project Overview

This project systematically evaluates the accessibility and efficiency of Melbourne's public transport network, focusing on the Box Hill area. By integrating multiple datasets and applying advanced spatial-temporal analysis techniques, the project identifies service gaps and provides data-driven recommendations for transport planning.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- **Assess Accessibility**: Quantify transport accessibility across different residential areas
- **Identify Service Gaps**: Locate unserved areas with poor transport connectivity
- **Analyze Efficiency**: Evaluate service efficiency based on passenger flow and waiting times
- **Provide Recommendations**: Deliver actionable insights for transport planning improvement

## ðŸ”§ Technical Approach

### Data Integration
- **PTV GTFS Data**: Real-time public transport schedules and routes
- **ABS Geographical Dataset**: Australian Bureau of Statistics mesh block data
- **SQL Processing**: Data cleaning and integration using advanced SQL queries

### Methodology
1. **Spatial Analysis**: Used QGIS for comprehensive spatial-temporal analysis
2. **Accessibility Scoring**: Developed a multi-factor accessibility model
3. **Service Gap Identification**: Mapped residential areas >300m from transport stops
4. **Efficiency Assessment**: Analyzed peak-hour passenger flow and service duration

### Key Technologies
- **GIS Tools**: QGIS, PostGIS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with spatial extensions
- **Programming**: Python, SQL
- **Analysis**: Spatial statistics, network analysis

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings

### Accessibility Issues
- **Service Gaps**: Identified 156 residential mesh blocks with poor accessibility
- **Walking Distance**: 23% of residents live >300m from nearest transport stop
- **Connectivity**: Heavy reliance on bus services with limited rail coverage

### Efficiency Bottlenecks
- **Peak Hour Congestion**: Average waiting times exceed 15 minutes during rush hours
- **Service Frequency**: Significant variations in service frequency across different routes
- **Network Redundancy**: Limited alternative routes in case of service disruptions

### Spatial Patterns
- **Hotspot Analysis**: Concentrated service gaps in outer suburban areas
- **Accessibility Gradient**: Clear accessibility decline with distance from CBD
- **Infrastructure Inequality**: Uneven distribution of transport infrastructure

## ðŸš€ Impact & Recommendations

### Delivered Recommendations
1. **Infrastructure Development**: Prioritize rail extension to underserved areas
2. **Bus Service Optimization**: Increase frequency on high-demand routes
3. **Accessibility Improvement**: Target 47 critical mesh blocks for service expansion
4. **Multimodal Integration**: Improve connections between different transport modes

### Stakeholder Engagement
- **PTV Collaboration**: Recommendations delivered to Public Transport Victoria
- **Policy Impact**: Findings contributed to transport planning discussions
- **Community Benefit**: Improved understanding of transport equity issues

## ðŸŽ¨ Visualizations

The project includes comprehensive visualizations:
- **Accessibility Heat Maps**: Visual representation of service accessibility
- **Network Coverage Analysis**: Transport network overlay with population density
- **Service Gap Maps**: Highlighted areas requiring immediate attention
- **Efficiency Dashboards**: Real-time performance metrics visualization

## ðŸ“ˆ Technical Skills Demonstrated

- **Spatial Data Analysis**: Advanced GIS techniques and spatial statistics
- **Database Management**: Complex SQL queries and spatial database operations
- **Data Visualization**: Professional maps and interactive dashboards
- **Research Methodology**: Systematic approach to urban computing problems
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Translation of technical findings into actionable recommendations

## ðŸ”® Future Enhancements

- **Real-time Integration**: Incorporate live traffic and disruption data
- **Predictive Modeling**: Forecast future accessibility changes
- **Mobile Application**: Develop user-friendly accessibility assessment tool
- **Multi-city Comparison**: Extend analysis to other Australian cities
