### Project Overview
This project focused on building and tuning a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression model to predict property prices. It involved advanced feature engineering using regular expressions to extract key features from unstructured text descriptions, significantly enhancing model accuracy.

### Key Contributions
- Ensured model robustness through rigorous 10-fold cross-validation.
- Performed a systematic K-value grid search to find the optimal number of neighbors.
- Implemented comprehensive data preprocessing, including one-hot encoding for categorical variables and scaling for numerical features.

### Core Technologies
- **Languages & Libraries**: R, caret, grepl
- **Algorithms**: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression
- **Techniques**: Regex, Cross-Validation, Feature Engineering
